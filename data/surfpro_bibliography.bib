As a whole, these surfactants had desirable foaming properties and efficient wetting abilities. Furthermore, synergism in foaming and wetting abilities was observed in a binary mixture of these surfactants with an alkyloxyethylene sulfate.},

Furthermore, the dodecanoyl ester had excellent foaming properties. The new surfactants also showed antimicrobial activity. Thus, the most potent compound, the dodecanoyl ester, was able to inhibit growth of both bacterial (Gram‐positive as well as Gram‐negative) and fungal test strains. The antimicrobial effect was somewhat weaker compared to benzalkonium chloride, one of the most frequently used cationics for topical disinfection. However, compared to benzalkonium chloride, the new cationics exhibit a highly improved compatibility with anionic surfactants, as no precipitation took place even in highly concentrated solutions thereby providing a much more robust antimicrobial system. Finally, the new surfactants are expected to be readily biodegradable because they are carbohydrate ester‐based.},

The adsorption at the air/solution interface of all the compounds were quantitative described using the Frumkin model, and the effect of alkyl chain length on surface activity and aggregate behavior was analyzed. It was found that all the gemini amphiphiles possess surface activity and low critical micellization concentration ({CMC}) values. The values of log {CMC} depended linearly on the carbon number of the alkyl chains, but the surface tension at the {CMC} (γ

Combinations of {DLS} and {TEM} observations showed the existence of vesicles with a broad size distribution in aqueous solution.

The surface activities of the cationic surfactants were correlated with their chemical structure. The surface activities of the surfactants increased with increasing the hydrophobic chain length. The adsorption and micellization tendencies of the surfactants in solution were determined using the free energies of adsorption and micellization.

              Switchable surfactants are environment‐friendly compounds, which can be separated from the system or lose surface activity after completing their function during one stage of a process. In order to study switchable properties of a kind of {CO}
              2
              switchable surfactant with an imidazoline group, four 2‐alkyl‐1‐hydroxyethylimidazolines were synthesized by condensation of

              ‐(2‐hydroxyethyl)ethanediamine with dodecanoic, tetradecanoic, hexadecanoic, and octadecanoic acids.

The critical micelle concentration ({CMC}) and surface tension at {CMC} (γ
              cmc
              ) measured by the Wilhelmy plate technique show that these surfactants have excellent surface activity. The changes of conductivity before and after bubbling {CO}

              reversibly and repeating this three times. However, their switchable function on the emulsification‐demulsification of water‐alkane was dissatisfactory due to the emulsibility of amide which was hydrolyzed from 2‐alkyl‐1‐hydroxyethylimidazoline. Therefore, the application of these switchable surfactants needed to be studied further.},

A good foaming agent should generate a stable foam, must be thermally stable ({\textgreater}90 °C, typical reservoir temperature), must have a high tolerance to salinity, and should have low adsorption on the reservoir rock. In view of this, four thermally stable and salt-tolerant polyoxyethylene cationic gemini surfactants were synthesized with different spacers (mono phenyl and biphenyl) and different counterions (Br− and Cl−). Foaming properties were evaluated using initial foam generation, foam volume stability at a given time, bubble count, and average foam bubble radius. The effect of counterions and nature of spacers, with and without the presence of salts, on foaming properties was evaluated. It was found that number of phenyl rings (mono phenyl and biphenyl) had no significant effect on foamability and foam stability in the presence or absence of salts. However, the effect of counterions was prominent in deionized water. In deionized water, foam generated by gemini surfactants with bromide as a counterion was more stable compared to the foam generated using the surfactant containing chloride as the counterion. In saline solution, the type of counterion had no effect on the foamability or foam stability of the foam generated using synthesized cationic gemini surfactants. The foam volume stability decreased by the addition of salts; however, a further increase in salt concentration enhanced the foam volume stability. The synthesized surfactants showed good thermal stability, salt tolerance, and foaming properties and can be an attractive choice for upstream applications.},

	abstract = {Cationic gemini surfactants with polymethylene spacer and linear alkyl chains containing an even number of carbon atoms have been extensively studied in the recent past, with the emphasis put on the determination of their aggregation behaviour in aqueous solution and their biological properties. However, the information on the aggregation of branched gemini surfactants with an odd number of carbon atoms in their alkyl chains is only sparsely reported in the literature. To help cover this gap in the research of cationic gemini surfactants, a series of branched bisammonium cationic gemini surfactants with an odd number of carbon atoms in alkyl chains (tridecane-2-yl chains) and a polymethylene spacer with a variable length ranging from 3 to 12 carbon atoms have been synthesized and investigated. Critical micelle concentration, which was determined by three methods, was found to be in the order 10−4 mol/L. A comparison of the obtained data of the novel series of tridecyl chain geminis with those of gemini surfactants with dodecyl chains and an identical spacer structure revealed that structural differences between both series of gemini surfactants result in different aggregation and surface properties for surfactants with 6 and 8 methylene groups in the spacer (N,N’-bis(tridecane-2-yl)-N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylhexane-1,6-diaminium dibromide and N,N’-bis(tridecane-2-yl)-N,N,N’,N’-tetramethyloctane-1,8-diaminium dibromide) with the cmc values 8.2 × 10−4 mol/L and 6.5 × 10−4 mol/L, respectively, as determined by surface tension measurements. Particle size analysis showed the formation of small stable spherical micelles in the interval between 2.8 and 5 nm and with zeta potential around +50 {mV}, which are independent of surfactant concentration and increase with the increasing spacer length. Microbicidal activity of 13-s-13 gemini surfactants was found to be efficient against Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and yeast.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              Modern cutting fluids often are real aqueous solutions of chemical compounds. That form of cutting fluid is simpler in preparation, as compared to emulsions and microemulsions. The water base is a good cooling medium of high‐ecological value. The purpose of this paper is to discover water‐soluble additives that could improve the lubricity of water.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              Three cationic surfactants were chosen to be analyzed. Their tribological properties were verified using two testers: T0‐2 (four‐ball machine) and T‐11 (ball‐on‐disk). The results of the tests performed using friction couples made of steel (T0‐2, T‐11) and steel‐ceramics (T‐11) were satisfactory.
            
            
              Findings
              The friction coefficients and wear scar diameters are even a few times smaller, as compared to the ones measured in a water environment.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The paper demonstrates that the crucial role in improvement of the tribological properties is played by the surface activity of the additives (confirmed by the measurements of the surface tension and wetting angle). As the cationic surfactants are bactericidal and anti‐corrosive, they can be classified as multi‐purpose additives modifying water lubricity.},

	abstract = {The adsorption layer of the nonionic surfactant triethoxy monooctylether C8E3 has been investigated at the free water surface by means of both experimental and computer simulation methods. The surface tension of the aqueous solution of C8E3 has been measured by pendant drop shape analysis in the entire concentration range in which C8E3 is soluble in water. The data obtained from these measurements are used to derive the adsorption isotherm. The critical micellar concentration and the surface excess concentration of the saturated adsorption layer are found to be 7.48 {mM} and 4.03μmol∕m2, respectively, the latter value corresponding to the average area per molecule of 41Å2. In order to analyze the molecular level structure of the unsaturated adsorption layer, Monte Carlo simulations have been performed at four different surface concentration values, i.e., 0.68, 1.36, 2.04, and 2.72μmol∕m2, respectively. It has been found that the water surface is already almost fully covered at the lowest surface density value investigated, and the adsorbed molecules show a strong preference for lying parallel with the interface in elongated conformations. No sign of the penetration of the hydrophilic triethoxy headgroups into the aqueous phase to any extent has been observed. With increasing surface densities the preferential orientation of the apolar octyl tails gradually turns from lying parallel with the interface to pointing toward the vapor phase by their {CH}3 end, whereas the conformation of the adsorbed molecules becomes gradually less elongated. Both of these changes lead to the increase of the number of C8E3 molecules being in a direct contact (i.e., forming hydrogen bonds) with water. However, the increasing number of the C8E3 molecules hydrogen bonded to water is found to be accompanied by the weakening of this binding, i.e., the decrease of both the number of hydrogen bonds a bound C8E3 molecule forms with water and the magnitude of the average binding energy of the adsorbed C8E3 molecules.},

              The adsorption of xylyl-substituted biquaternary ammonium salt Gemini surfactants with different spacer (C3 and C6) at polytetrafluoroethylene ({PTFE}) and polymethylmethacrylate ({PMMA}) surfaces has been investigated and the different adsorption parameters such as surface tension, contact angle, adhesional tension, solid–water interfacial tension and work of adhesion have been estimated. The results show that C3 and C6 have similar adsorption behaviors at {PTFE} and {PMMA} surfaces. C3 and C6 adsorb gradually at a {PFTE}–water interface
              via
              hydrophobic interactions and the adsorption amounts at the water–air interface are almost three times higher than those at the {PTFE}–water interface due to the steric hindrance effect. However, the contact angle keeps constant throughout the experimental concentration range because the decrease in surface tension just counterbalances the decrease in {PFTE}–water interfacial tension. On the other hand, C3 and C6 adsorb at the {PMMA} surface
              via
              polar interactions between xylyl and functional groups of {PMMA} before {CMC}. Similar to {PTFE}, the increase in {PMMA}–water interfacial tension compensates the decrease in surface tension and the contact angle also shows a stationary value before the {CMC}. A bi-layer structure of C3 and C6 will be formed at the {PMMA}–water interface
              via
              hydrophobic interaction and {PMMA}–water interfacial tension decreases consequently after the {CMC}, which results in the decrease in contact angle.},

              A cationic surfactant with a Guerbet-type branched tail and hydroxyl-decorated head group was synthesized and characterized. Its properties including surface activity, dynamic surface tension, wetting ability, concentration/salt induced aggregation pattern transition and rheological responses of aqueous solutions were measured and analyzed. It was found that this new amphiphile possessed powerful surface activity (

              = 25.26 {mN} m

It was determined that the introduction of branching hydrophobes and hydroxyls into the amphiphilic material crucially contributed to the superior performances. Moreover, a visual transition with increasing concentration of its aqueous solution was observed, while the addition of the structure-forming additive sodium salicylate ({NaSal}) could highly improve the viscosity by inducing the micellar growth in the cationic system which was researched by rheological experiments. Scanning electron microscopy ({SEM}) and transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) were operated to investigate the transformation of aggregates which are responsible for the concentration/salt induced phase behavior transition or rheological responses.},

It was found that the inhibition efficiency increases with an increase in inhibitor concentrations and decreases with increasing temperature. Polarization data indicated that the investigated compounds act as mixed-type inhibitors, and the adsorption isotherm basically obeys the Langmuir isotherm. The corrosion inhibition mechanism was discussed based on the potential of zero charge value. An {SEM}/{EDX} studies confirmed that {CSSB} inhibitors could form films by adsorption on the carbon steel surface. The theoretical predictions exhibit good agreement with empirical results.},

              The Egyptian oil and gas industry is suffering from severe metal corrosion problems, particularly microbial‐induced corrosion. There is limited knowledge on the corrosion inhibition of carbon steels in the presence of an acidophilic, iron‐oxidizing bacterial species
              Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans
              . Therefore, in this study, novel Gemini cationic surfactants, in three forms depending on variation in alkyl chains of 8, 12, and 16 carbon atoms named {FHPAO}, {FHPAD}, and {FHPAH}, respectively, were synthesized and characterized by Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The surface parameters and the thermodynamic of the synthesized surfactants were evaluated at three different temperatures, 20, 40, and 60 °C. The synthesized Gemini cationic surfactants were tested as broad‐spectrum antimicrobial, antibacterial and anticandida agents. They evaluated as biocides and corrosion inhibitors against
              Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans
              . {FHPAD} showed higher adsorption ability at the solution interface and higher affinity to construct micelles than {FHPAO} and {FHPAH}. Both adsorption and micellization processes were hydrophobic and temperature dependent. {FHPAO}, {FHPAD} and {FHPAH} exhibited wide‐spectrum antimicrobial activities, and the highest activity and the lowest minimum bactericidal/fungicidal inhibitory concentrations were attributed to {FHPAD}. Furthermore, synthesized {FHPAD} demonstrated the highest metal corrosion inhibition efficiency of 95.5\% at 5 {mM} in comparison to 87.5\% and 81.7\% for {FHPAO} and {FHPAH}, respectively. In conclusion, this study provides novel synthesized cationic surfactants with many applications in the oil and gas industry, such as broad‐spectrum antimicrobial, biocides, and corrosion inhibitors for acidophilic, iron‐oxidizing bacterial species

            The surface parameters of some cationic surfactants having different hydrophobic alkyl chains were assessed in aqueous solution using different techniques; surface tension, ultraviolet‐Visible ({UV}–Vis) spectroscopy, and conductivity measurements. The obtained critical micelle concentration ({CMC}) for N‐(2‐((3,4‐dimethoxybenzylidene)amino)ethyl)‐N,N‐dimethyloctan‐1‐aminium bromide ({DBAO}), N‐(2‐((3,4‐dimethoxybenzylidene)amino)ethyl)‐N,N‐dimethyldodectan‐1‐aminium bromide ({DBAD}), and N‐(2‐((3,4‐dimethoxybenzylidene)amino)ethyl)‐N,N‐dimethylhexadectan‐1‐aminium bromide ({DBAH}) in aqueous solution using three techniques are nearly the same. Increasing the hydrophobic chain length enhances micelle formation. Raising the solution temperature from 25 to 65 °C also shows the same trend. The thermodynamic calculations outlined the adsorption propensity of the surfactants at the surface compared to their affinity to form micelles. Both micellization and adsorption processes are enhanced with both the hydrocarbon elongation and with raising the solution temperature. The effect of the surfactant tail on the preparation process of the silver nanoparticles ({AgNP}) was assessed and confirmed using transmission electron microscope ({TEM}), dynamic light scattering ({DLS}), and {UV}–Vis spectra. Increasing the surfactant tail leads to a smaller particle size with a narrow distribution. The stability of the prepared {AgNP} is enhanced with hydrophobic surfactant tail elongation as proved with increasing the zeta‐potential of the prepared {AgNP} colloid. The foaming power, interfacial tension, and emulsification stability of the {DBAO}, {DBAD}, and {DBAH} surfactants were determined. The {DBAO}, {DBAD}, and {DBAH} surfactants showed good antimicrobial activities against both bacteria (Gram positive and negative) and fungi, which have been enhanced because of incorporation of {AgNP}.},

              A series of polyether‐based silicone surfactants with different hydrophobic chains (trimethylsiloxy, triethylsiloxy, and triisopropylsiloxy) were synthesized. The molecular structures were confirmed using
